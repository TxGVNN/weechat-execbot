== About =====================
Execbot is a bot can execute the command from IRC message
(You maybe want to call it is a kind of backdoor)

With server is installed execbot script, the client can execute the
command remote by send privmsg to server's nick in IRC network

== Usage =====================
/excebot list                                List server.nicknames are allowed
/execbot add -server <server> nicknames..    Add server.nicknames are allowed to execute
/execbot del -server <server> nicknames..    Remove server.nicknames are allowed

== NOTICE ====================
This is a POC that I want to execute a remote command via IRC
network. It's really not security, although you can set who can
talk with the bot.

PLEASE CONSIDER CAREFULLY WHEN USING THE PLUGIN
